      <p>Iâ€™m a friendly full-stack engineer, with a creative spirit. 
This means I am highly flexible and have the ability to carry out frontend and backend tasks together or independently. I try to keep my websites and applications simple and introduce animation where I feel it has the most impact. I also have a keen interest in A.I.
